# 🔎 GlassBox AI: making AI Transparent

GlassBox AI is a tool designed to reverse engineer AI's reasoning process and provide a breakdown of why it made specific choices. 

## **💡 Motivation**
Artificial intelligence is shaping our world at an accelerating pace, from **automated hiring decisions** to **predictive healthcare models** and **financial risk assessments.** But there's a big problem: **AI doesn’t explain itself.**
We don’t really know **how or why** AI models reached this or that conclusion. The world is relying on **black-box systems** with **hidden biases, unknown logic and unverifiable reasoning.**  

💡 **The challenge:** AI decision making is opaque.  
💀 **The risk:** Bias, misinformation, and flawed logic can go undetected.  
🚀 **The mission:** Make AI **transparent, explainable, and accountable.**  

## **⚡ What This Project Does**
✔ **Highlights AI’s reasoning process** → Identifies the most influential parts of an AI-generated response.  
✔ **Token impact visualization** → Shows how much weight was given to different words or phrases.  
✔ **Simplifies AI transparency** → Makes explainability accessible without overwhelming complexity.  

💡 This is an **experimental prototype** focused on solving an **urgent, real-world AI problem** in a **practical, hands-on way.**  

## **📌 Roadmap**
📌 **Phase 1:** Extract log probabilities & token weights from AI-generated text.  
📌 **Phase 2:** Build an interactive frontend to showcase AI thinking.  
📌 **Phase 3:** Develop real-time AI response analysis.  
📌 **Phase 4:** Expand to bias detection & model auditing.

# 🔎 GlassBox AI: making AI Transparent

Hi frens! GlassBox AI is a tool I'm designing to reverse engineer AI's reasoning process, breaking down why it makes certain choices and how it weighs different inputs. This is just the first in a series of small but impactful projects I want to develop to tackle real-world AI challenges, from ethical concerns to transparency issues, as AI becomes increasingly embedded in our lives.

## 💡 Motivation
Artificial intelligence is shaping our world at an accelerating pace, from automated hiring decisions to predictive healthcare models and financial risk assessments. But here's the thing: AI doesn’t explain itself. We can't really know how or why AI models reached this or that conclusion. More and more, the world is relying on blackbox systems with hidden biases, unknown logic and unverifiable reasoning. 

💡 **The challenge:** AI decision making is opaque.  
💀 **The risk:** Bias, misinformation, and flawed logic can go undetected.  
🚀 **The mission:** Make AI **transparent, explainable, and accountable.**  

## What This Project Does
✔ **Highlights AI’s reasoning process** → Identifies the most influential parts of an AI-generated response.  
✔ **Token impact visualization** → Shows how much weight was given to different words or phrases.  
✔ **Simplifies AI transparency** → Makes explainability accessible without overwhelming complexity.  

💡 This is an **experimental prototype** focused on solving an **urgent, real-world AI problem** in a **practical, hands-on way.**  

## **📌 Roadmap**
📌 **Phase 1:** Extract log probabilities & token weights from AI-generated text.  
📌 **Phase 2:** Build an interactive frontend to showcase AI thinking.  
📌 **Phase 3:** Develop real-time AI response analysis.  
📌 **Phase 4:** Expand to bias detection & model auditing.  


## **🛠 Tech Stack**
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **AI Models:** OpenAI API  
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Data Processing:** NLP techniques & log probability extraction  


## **🚧 Current Status**
✅ **Step 1:** Backend setup & OpenAI API integration  
⏳ **Step 2:** Extracting AI reasoning & log probabilities  
⏳ **Step 3:** Building an interactive frontend to showcase AI thinking
